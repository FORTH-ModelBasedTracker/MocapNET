Finishing my PhD this will probably be the *final* version of MocapNET!
MocapNET 4 will deal with upperbody / lowerbody / hands / eye tracking and / facial capture
It has a written from scratch python interface, but maintain the same compatible BVH output format.
It will also be compatible with Raspberry Pi 4 and use Tensorflow /Tf-Lite / ONNX backends
  
This branch is still missing a lot of things so you can safely ignore it for now..!
